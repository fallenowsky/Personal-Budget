This app is designed to control a personal budget of a person.
You can add an income or expense with the date and it is stored in data base. 
You can search to display incomes and expenses from a special period of time, from last month and actual month.
It gives the opportunity to add as many users as you wish and each of them has his own incomes and expenses.
Incomes and expenses overviews display your incoomes, expenses and balance which is calculated according to data you have typed.
Users, incomes and expenses data are stored in XML file.
I use CMarkup library to work with XML file. 
This app was whole coded in Object Oriented Programming standart.
